Sub: Invitation to visit USA 

Ana, 

I would like to invite you to the United States of America to stay with at my home from as early as you can get here in December 2011 to as long as you can through January 2012. Any length of time in the period would be great. Maybe you can even stay for two months! I would love to introduce you to my family, and show you around some of the neighboring states such as New York, and Washington DC. 

My family would love to host you at our home located at 4603 Prosepect ave, Reisterstown MD 21136.

If the embassy people have any questions they are welcome to contact me directly at any of the contact methods in the signature.

Yours lovingly,
Todd Morrill
